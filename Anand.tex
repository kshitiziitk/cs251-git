\section{Premise}
The story of a terminally ill man who wishes to live life to the full before the inevitable occurs, as told by his best friend.
\section{My comments}
One of the few Hindi movies I have watched and it is indeed an heart wrenching tale with excellent acting from Rajesh Khanna.
It is cool.
